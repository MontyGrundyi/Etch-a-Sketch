Sketch Pad
This project is a simple webpage that allows you to create a sketch pad with a customizable grid. It's a fun way to unleash your creativity and doodle away!

Features

- 16x16 Grid: The webpage features a 16x16 grid of square divs dynamically created using JavaScript.
- Flexbox Layout: The grid squares are arranged using Flexbox, creating a neat grid layout.
- Hover Effect: As you hover your mouse over the grid squares, they change color, leaving a pixelated trail like a pen would.
- Customizable Grid Size: A button at the top of the screen allows you to specify the number of squares per side for a new grid. The existing grid is
  removed, and a new one is generated while maintaining the same total space.
- Limit on Grid Size: To prevent excessive resource usage, the user input for grid size is limited to a maximum of 100 squares per side.

Instructions
To set up and use the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Hover over the grid squares to draw.
4. Click the "Change Grid Size" button to specify a new grid size and start sketching again.

Extra Credit
There are two extra credit tasks available:

1. Randomized RGB Values: Modify the squares so that they have random RGB values with each interaction.
2. Progressive Darkening Effect: Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction with a square darkens it by 10%, aiming to achieve a completely black square after ten interactions.
   Feel free to try out these challenges and enhance your sketching experience!
